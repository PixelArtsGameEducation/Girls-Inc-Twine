With the Mythos Challenge, East Metro STEAM partners Girls, Inc. and Pixel Arts Game Education teamed up to offer pro-girl and pro-youth camps in STEAM for youth across network partners. Inspired by the affirmation of "Girls are Smart, Strong, and Bold", 35 youth designed and created prototype games, stories, and animations by working together; in October at the Girls, Inc. teen action network gathering, the Spark Summit, these projects will be shown for other girls to playtest their creations and hear about their experience and goals. The hope is that these girls, and more, will enter the 2017 Mythos Challenge and become inspired leaders in digital storytelling, games, and apps. 

As a 2017 Pocket of Innovation Award, the goal is to build a close network between organizations to support girls and youth aspirations. What is striking is not only how excited and engaged the girls and youth were, but also that they wonderfully supported and encouraged each other for success. They helped each other react innovatively to failures, problem solve, and affirm healthy relationships as a community of Girls and Youth makers in STEAM. 

The Prototype Playcade will—with the consent of their makers and community support by youth and partners—get travel to other locations.
